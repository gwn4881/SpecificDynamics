      <h1>DEMETER Platform</h1>
      <p>
        The DEMETER Platform is a versatile agricultural drone designed to help farmers improve crop yields and optimize
        their farming operations. Equipped with advanced sensors and imaging technology, the drone can provide real-time
        information on crop and soil metrics, as well as production animal metrics.
        The drone's advanced sensors can measure soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels, providing farmers with
        valuable insights into the health of their crops and soil. The drone can also capture high-resolution images of
        crops, allowing farmers to monitor plant health, growth, and yield.
        The DEMETER Platform is also equipped with animal monitoring capabilities, allowing farmers to keep track of
        livestock health and performance. The drone can capture data on animal movement, behavior, and feed consumption,
        helping farmers optimize their livestock production and improve animal welfare.
