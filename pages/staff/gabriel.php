                <p>
                Gabriel Nellis, Chief Operations Officer. I served 4 years active duty in the USMC. Using the experiences from those years, I helped establish Specific Dynamics and obtained a DOD contract to create and deliver the ATLAS platform. As the COO, I ensure that the company runs smoothly and efficiently. I help oversee the day to day operations of each department within the company and help come up with plans for the long term growth and improvement of Specific Dynamics and its employees.
