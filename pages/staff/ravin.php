                Ravin Looknauth, Chief Financial Officer. I have been a co-founder of Specific Dynamics and I work mainly in the accounting department. Making sure we pay our employees, managing assets and making sure we do not go bankrupt. I help out where ever help is needed and was able to bring the idea and the production of the Chiron platform. I manage the funding at Specific Dynamics Humanitarian Relief Fund making we give back to places in need.
